# Overview
My work on Harvard's online extension course [CS50AI](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/). The course teaches a high-level overview of various
fundamental concepts of machine learning, neural networks, and artificial intelligience in general. Note that
most of the projects are in working order, but both the Minesweeper and Crossword projects may have a few
issues in them causing them to not always function properly
